## WHAT IS REACT
- a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- lean and focused component-based UI library
- if you want to add extra features like routing, you have to install third party
library because React focuses on the components

## WHY REACT INSTEAD OF JAVASCRIPT ONLY
- using vanilla JavaScript sometime makes simple things to complex, you have to
write a very repetitive code just to implement something.
- on react, we can directly write html inside a JavaScript, the react library will
handle all the conversion for us.
- react is way easier to use
- react reduce the complexity of coding
- react can control a section of a page or the entire page

## SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA)
- doesn't require multiple pages to request another page, JavaScript with React
handles everything


## REACT JS
- React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interface simpler
- React is all about components
