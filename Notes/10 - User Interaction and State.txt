## USER INTERACTION AND STATE

## EVENTS AND EVENT HANDLERS
# VANILLA JAVASCRIPT
  document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click',()=>{})
  or
  <button on-click="functionA()">Click</button>
# REACT
  <button onClick={functionA()}>Click</button>

## HOW REACT WORKS
- when React is loaded, it convert all the JSX into HTML and JavaScript
- React does not repeat after rendering the DOM at first load
- everything is reevaluated at first load from the root js to components

## STATE
- allows us to declare values as state
- since react render only at first load, we will not be able to change on the
rendered DOM, here is where we use state
- it handles variables on react
- when the state changes, the component is reevaluated
- state is not a react specific concept but a key concept of react

## STATE ARE DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR VARIABLE
- only a state can trigger an reevaluation after the first render of react
- every time the state changes, react reevaluates the component render
- regular variable cannot trigger reevaluation
- react ignores regular variables, so it wont trigger anything even it is changed

## STATE FUNCTION
useState - is one of the react hook
- react hooks must be called only inside a component function
- return two values, first is the variable you set, the second one is a function
use to update the variable you set
- use to register a state for specific component
