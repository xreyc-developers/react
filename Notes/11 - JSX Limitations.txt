## JSX LIMITATIONS
- adjacent root elements returns an error
- everything must be wrapped under one element
- if everything is wrapped with div, we will have a problem called '<div> Soup'
- div Soup means, that if the elements are compiled, there will be a lot of unnecessary
div element wrapping a list of element.
- many div wrapping, may sometimes break styling and too many too many element
- the lesser the html element the better


## SOLUTIONS
# WRAPPER COMPONENT: creating a wrapper component that automatically returns its children.
const Wrapper = props => props.children
export default Wrapper

# FRAGMENTS Using fragments: this does not render a div wrapping element
- frament was a component wrapper pre-made by react developers
import React from 'react';
<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
or
<></>

OR
import {Fragment} from 'react';
<Fragment></Fragment>
