## CLASS BASED COMPONENTS
- components can also be defined as JS classes where a render() method defines
the to-be-rendered output.
- this rarely used, this is used on the old days.
- in the past, you have to use class-based components to manage state (below v.16.8)

SYNTAX:
class Product extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hello</h2>
  }
}

## LIFE CYCLE
- you can't use current react hooks
- you cannot hooks like useEffect()
# CLASS HOOKS
* componentDidMount()
  - runs when component is mounted (was evaluated and rendered)
  - this is the equivalent to useEffect(...,[]) (with no dependencies)
* componentDidUpdate()
  - called once component updated (was evaluated and updated)
  - this is the equivalent to userEffect(...,[dependency]) (with dependency)
* componentWillUnmount()
  - called right before component is unmounted (remove from DOM)
  - equivalent to useEffect(() => { return () => {...}},[]) (the cleanup function)
