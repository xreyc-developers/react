## FORM AND INPUTS

# STATES
1. Submitted
- validate when user click submit
- for final validation
- cannot validate during and after input
PROBLEM
- you have to submit first before everything is validated

2. Losing Focus (On Blur)
- when user leaves specific field
- good when you want to validate at the end of inputs
- cannot validate during input
PROBLEM
- if invalid occurs, on next input, you will not be able to validate the field
immediately when the user input again unless the user stop.
- the state valid or invalid state will remain unless you stop so that the field
will be evaluated

3. On Every Keystroke
- every time the user inputs something
- validation on every keystroke
PROBLEM
- since every input is evaluated, an error might automatically occur without
letting the user finish his/her input
