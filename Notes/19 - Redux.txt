## REDUX
- is a cross component app-wide state

## TYPES OF STATE
# Local State
  - belongs to a single component
  - using useState or useReducer
# Cross-Component State
  - state that used on different component via props or event
  - using props
# App-Wide State (Redux or react context)
  - state for the entire app
  - all component can access
  - use case: user authentication
  - an alternative for react context

## REACT CONTEXT VS REDUX
# REACT CONTEXT
  * ADVANCETAGE
    - good for small and medium application
  * DISADVANTAGE
    - complex setup/management
    - you can build one big provider for a list of state but things will become
    bloated.
    - if you split the context into many state management you will have nested
    wrapper in order to implement app wide state
    - performance, good only for low frequency changes
# REDUX
  - can be able to manage multiple state without a bloated functionality
  - can able to handle high frequency changes


## HOW REDUX WORKS
- one data (state) store
- you can store everything in a centralize way
