## NEXT JS

# TWO TYPES OF GENERATION
- Static Generation
- Server Side Generation

# STATIC GENERATION (THIS IS EXECUTED ON THE BUILD PROCESS)
# getStaticProps
- not executed on the server and client
- a reserved words
- this is executed during prerendering stage
- this will wait for data fetching then render the application on the server side.
- this can be asynchronous
# Problem
- data could be outdated, since it is rendered on the build process
- solution is to use revalidate property
# REVALIDATION
// THIS IS THE NUMBER OF SECONDS NEXT JS WILL WAIT
// UNTIL IT REGENERATE THE PAGE ON REQUEST (ON THE SERVER)
// THIS WILL UPDATE THE PRE-GENERATED PAGES
// THIS IS GOOD IF THE DATA DOESN'T CHANGE FREQUENTY

## SERVER SIDE GENERATION
- the request is generated on fly during user request
# getServerSideProps
- reserved function for pre-prerendering (server side)
