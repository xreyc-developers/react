## CSS ON COMPONENT
- on react you can import CSS inside JavaScript directly which is not normal on
JavaScript.

# Adding a css file
import './location/file'

# Using a Class
return (
  <div className="class">
  </div>
)

# CLASSNAME IS A PROPERTY
- class name is a property, you can get its value if you use it on a component
- behind the scene, react takes the className property to used as a styling
- but if you use it on a custom component, it will not work since we are not
using it.
- if using className on ang normal html, react takes it as a class
- if using className on a component, react takes it as a property
